            <div>
              Battleship is a two-player board game where players try to guess
              the location of the opponent's warships and sink them by firing
              shots into their board.
            </div>
            <div>
              In single player, you will always be Player 1.<br />
              In multiplayer, the game will alert which player's turn it is.<br /><b>
                The opponent must not look at the screen until it is their
                turn.</b

              Each player places ships on a 10x10 grid, keeping their ships'
              locations secret from their opponent. The ships can be placed
              horizontally or vertically.
            </div>
            <div>
              Players take turns selecting shots to fire onto their opponents
              board, which are labelled as hits or misses after firing.
