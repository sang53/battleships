Bugs:
  Make sure all player references are 1 & 2
  Ship placement - rotating ships after selecting them off the board rotates them
  shot select - 2 player ships do not hide properly

Improvements:
  Start screen - have some random ships and random shots placed => periodically update?
  Add instructions
  styling
  Re-write tests
